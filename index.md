# A weekly cube draft event in Hadley, MA
<p>We aim to foster an inclusive environment for social interaction and friendly competition.</p>
<p>We collectively learn and improve at Magic together as a community, lowering the emotional stakes of the entire process.</p>
<p>Avoiding a tournament structure promotes positive interactions and improves accessibility to newer players.</p>

# Time and Place
<p>Join us on Thursdays nights at X9 Games in Hadley, MA (Hampshire Mall, by the food court).</p>
<p>Check-in is at 5:30PM, draft fires at 6PM.</p>
